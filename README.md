# traffic_sign_detection
In this Python project ,we  built a deep neural network model that can classify traffic signs present in the image into different categories. With this model, we are able to read and understand traffic signs which are a very important task for all autonomous vehicles.

We have taken the Dataset from Kaggle and downloaded it into our machine. Due to a large number of files, I am not uploading them to Github.
The Dataset link is https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign.
